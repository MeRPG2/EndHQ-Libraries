EndHQ-Libraries
===============

NOTE! THE LIBRARIES ARE FOR THE CRAFTBUKKIT API RUNNING v1_7_R4 ONLY DUE TO NMS CALLS!

These are the libraries I have created and compiled. As you may see when you look at the source, some of it has come from other libraries. I made this for personal use, but I have received requests to put it on GitHub, so here it is. My goal with this project is to make the most expansive library possible, containing everything that cannot be done with ease in the Bukkit API.

I encourage you to fork, commit and all that other stuff if you like.

Please, before doing anything, read the liscense. Seriously... Do it.

Thank you!
